## Description

Getting data with fetch method from NASA `Astronomy Picture of the Day` API and recreate their website.

## Implementation

- When we open up the page, the daily image with a title and an explanation shows up
- If the daily picture is an image then use `image` if youtube video then use `iframe`
- The data is matching with the information on `https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html`
- There is an input where we can pick an older date --> if we change the value of the calendar, the content updates
